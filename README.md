Okay, I added the following at the very top, just changed "#name of the repo" with the actual name of the repo that's currently open, and separated the section with a horizontal line. Here is the updated ReadMe.md file:

## Overview 👀
Notes App is a simple app that lets you create and manipulate notes. It was created using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JS. You can add, edit, delete, and search for notes. The app also saves your notes to the local storage so you can access them later.
